		<text>AI-2 First Aid Kit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gunsl_eatable_medkit_descr">
		<text>A single-use universal medical kit, intended to treat some of the most common injuries any individual could receive. The contents include a variety of antibacterial, analgesic, radioprotective, and antiemetic medications. The painkillers are particularly strong, and when taken frequently or in combination with alcohol, can lead to addiction with other side effects. It's recommended to seek out a medical professional for treatment if this occurs. Despite the risk, these kits are always popular with stalkers due to their low cost and sufficient provisions for most trauma management.</text>

Unlike standard kits, this one contains Vikasolum, Batilolum and Naphazoline. The included medications were chosen in such a way that the possibility of side effects and overdose is minimized. However, extreme caution should be exercised when used in conjunction with other drugs, and they should never be combined with alcohol.</text>

The intention was to allow someone stranded out of cover to potentially survive an emission, but due to a lack of both clinical and field testing, its claims of effectiveness are dubious at best and may come with additional side effects.</text>
