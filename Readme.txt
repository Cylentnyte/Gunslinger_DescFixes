Version info:

- Compatible with base GUNSLINGER mod for Stalker: Call of Pripyat as of 11-17-24.
- This should not affect existing saved games.

Installation:

- Update to the latest version of GUNSLINGER
- Find your GUNSLINGER installation directory (NOT the main Stalker:CoP installation directory).
- Backup the "gamedata" folder if it already exists, especially if you're using other mods in combination with GUNSLINGER. Particularly, any that affect the same files edited here.
- Copy the included "gamedata" folder into this location and overwrite if asked.

Notes:

- Future GUNSLINGER updates may affect the ability of these files to load properly. If the game crashes on launch or fails to load, remove these files until the next available update.

Contact:

- I can usually be reached on Reddit, please notify me if there have been updates so I can get things working again. I will try to stay on top of this as long as there's interest from the community.
